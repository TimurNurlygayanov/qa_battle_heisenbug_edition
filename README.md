Introduction
------------

This is open source code of the QA Battle game,
which will be presented on QA Heisenbug 2019 
conference in Russia:
https://heisenbug-piter.ru/en/

This is a funny game for QA engineers who like 
searching and found bugs and logic games.

This game is very easy and the main idea of the game is to
get fun and involve more people to solve logical tasks.


Details Of How It Works
-----------------------

The project contains several HTML pages with JavaScript,
all these pages will be hosted by Ngnix web server on a
small virtual machine in Google cloud.

The players will open the page, click the links with answers,
solve logical tasks and at the end they will see the 
congratulation message. This is it.
